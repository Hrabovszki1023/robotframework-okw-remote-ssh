# robotframework-okw-remote-ssh

Standalone Robot Framework library for deterministic, synchronous remote interactions via SSH.

Provides session-based remote command execution, structured verification, 
and file transfer capabilities without dependencies on OKW Core or GUI adapters. 
Designed for CI usage, infrastructure validation, and cross-platform automation (Linux, macOS, Windows with OpenSSH).

Transport-neutral keyword design, strict separation of execution and verification, and zero GUI coupling.

## Goals

- Session-based remote execution
- Strict separation of execution and verification
- Transport-neutral keyword design
- Zero GUI coupling
- No dependency on OKW core

## Status

Initial skeleton – SSH backend not yet implemented.
