# robotframework-okw-remote-ssh

Standalone Robot Framework library for deterministic, synchronous remote interactions via SSH.

Provides session-based remote command execution, structured verification, and file transfer capabilities without dependencies on OKW Core or GUI adapters. Designed for CI usage, infrastructure validation, and cross-platform automation (Linux, macOS, Windows with OpenSSH).

Transport-neutral keyword design, strict separation of execution and verification, and zero GUI coupling.
